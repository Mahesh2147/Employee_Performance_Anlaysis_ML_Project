The features tell the relation between the dependent and independent variables. Pandas also help to describe the datasets answering following questions early in our project. The data present in the dataset are divided into numerical and categorical data.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Univariate Analysis: In univariate analysis we get the unique labels of categorical features, as well as get the range & density of numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bivariate Analysis: In bivariate analysis we check the feature relationship with target veriable.\n",

    "**Their is no constant column is present in Numerical as well as categoriacl data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Check Skewness of Numerical Features\n",
    "* Checking weather the data is Normally distributed or Not with Skewness.\n",

    "## 4.Data Pre-Processing\n",
    "1. Check Missing Value: Their is no missing value in data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Categorical Data Conversion: Handel categorical data with the help of frequency and mannual encoding, because feature is contain lot's of labels\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mannual Encoding: Mannual encoding is a best techinque to handel categorical feature with the help of map function, map the labels based on frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Frequency Encoding: Frequency encoding is an encoding technique to transform an original categorical variable to a numerical variable by considering the frequency distribution of the data getting value counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Outlier Handling Some features are contain outliers so we are impute this outlier with the help of IQR because in all features data is not normally distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Feature Transformation: In YearsSinceLastPromotion some skewed is present, so we are use Square Root Transformation techinque\n",
    "\n",
    "* Square root transformation: Square root transformation is one of the many types of standard transformations.This transformation is used for count data (data that follow a Poisson distribution) or small whole numbers. Each data point is replaced by its square root. Negative data is converted to positive by adding a constant, and then transformed.\n",
    "* Q-Q Plot: Qâ€“Q plot is a probability plot, a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scaling The Data: scaling the data with the help of Standard scalar\n",
    "\n",
    "* Standard Scaling: Standardization is the process of scaling the feature, it assumes the feature follow normal distribution and scale the feature between mean and standard deviation, here mean is 0 and standard deviation is always 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Drop unique and constant feature: Dropping employee number because this is a constant column as well as drop Years Since Last Promotion because we create a new feaure using square root transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Checking Correlation: Checking correlation with the help of heat map, and get the their is no highly correlated feature is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heatmap:** A heatmap is a graphical representation of data that uses a system of color-coding to represent different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check Duplicates: In this data Their is no dupicates is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. PCA: Use pca to reduce the dimension of data, Data is contain total 27 feature after dropping unique and constant column,from PCA it shows the 20 feature has less varaince loss, so we are going to select 20 feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high number of dimensions/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data. Formally, PCA is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Saving Pre-Process Data: save the all preprocess data in new file and add target feature to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.Machine learning Model Creation & Evaluation\n",
    "1. Define Dependant and Independant Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Balancing the data: The data is imbalance, so we need to balance the data with the help of SMOTE\n",
    "\n",
    "**SMOTE:** SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique) is one of the most commonly used oversampling methods to solve the imbalance problem. It aims to balance class distribution by randomly increasing minority class examples by replicating them. SMOTE synthesises new minority instances between existing minority instances.\n",
    "3.Splitting Training And Testing Data: 80% data use for training & 20% data used for testing\n",

    "* From EmpDepartment, development department is showing high performance rating.\n",
    "* Male performance rating is slightly higher than female in sales dapertment. Performance rating of 3 is more in sales department.\n",
    "* In Human Resources department most of the employees are having performance rating of 3. Female employees are performing good.\n",
    "* In Development department, maximum of the employees are having performance rating of 3. The male and female performance is nearly same for both.\n",
